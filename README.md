# LightArcade

Arduino-based arcade game with WS2812 LED strip, similar to 1980's Track &amp; Field

Made by Greg Schroeder & Scott James

We wanted to create a very interactive and intense video arcade game that could be enjoyed by all at the [Orlando Maker Faire 2015](http://www.makerfaireorlando.com/2015/).
