We wanted to create a very interactive and intense video arcade game that could be enjoyed by all at the [Orlando Maker Faire 2015](http://www.makerfaireorlando.com/2015/).  I do most electronic projects with Eagle CAD and homemade PCB, with switch debouncing done in software.

However, this time I wanted to try some new techniques.  Emphasis was placed on learning new build styles rather than just "best" practice.  It worked, I've learned a lot and had lots of fun doing it.  

## Goals in the hardware/software build:

  1. Use a veroboard, with DIYLC for layout, instead of custom PCB.
  2. Use DIYLC instead of Eagle CAD.
  3. Use custom plugs with Silicon RTV and Sugru connectors instead of off-the-shelf PCB connectors.  This seems silly, but I really wanted to try it.
  4. Instead of just Arduino, use Firmata along with Raspberry Pi.

## Things to try (if time allows):

  1. Integrate Sound playback, with MP3 decoder/playback; use DFPlayer module.
  2. Use WiFi bridge (with ESP8266) to broadcast high scores, engage users.
